# React + Magenta.js

Experimenting with ![Magenta.js](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-js); fiddling around with rhythm generation (ongoing)

## How to run the app

You need Node.js installed to run the application.

Clone or download the project from GitHub, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

The basic idea is that the VAE generates a rhythm, which the player has to match. If he fails to do so 5x, the game ends.
